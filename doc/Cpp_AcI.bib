	abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence has recently attained humanlike performance in a number of gamelike domains. These advances have been spurred by brain-inspired architectures and algorithms such as hierarchical filtering and reinforcement learning. OpenAI Gym is an open-source platform in which to train, test, and benchmark algorithms---it provides a range of tasks, including those of classic arcade games such as Doom. Here we describe how the platform might be used as a simulation, test, and diagnostic paradigm for psychiatric conditions.
Methods
To illustrate how active inference models of game play could be used to test mechanistic and algorithmic properties of psychiatric disorders, we provide two exemplar analyses. The first speaks to the impact of aging on cognition, examining game-play behaviors in a model of aging in which we compared age-dependent changes of younger (n = 9, 22 $\pm$ 1 years of age) and older (n = 7, 56 $\pm$ 5 years of age) adult players. The second is an illustration of a putative feature of anhedonia in which we simulated diminished sensitivity to reward.
Results
These simulations demonstrate how active inference can be used to test predicted changes in both neurobiology and beliefs in psychiatric cohorts. We show that, as well as behavioral measures, putative neural correlates of active inference can be simulated, and hypothesized (model-based) differences in local field potentials and blood oxygen level--dependent responses can be produced.
Conclusions
We show that active inference, through epistemic and value-based goals, enables simulated subjects to actively develop detailed representations of gaming environments, and we demonstrate the use of a principled algorithmic and neurobiological framework for testing hypotheses in psychiatric illness.},

@article{TSCHANTZ2022108266,
	abstract = {The adaptive regulation of bodily and interoceptive parameters, such as body temperature, thirst and hunger is a central problem for any biological organism. Here, we present a series of simulations using the framework of active inference to formally characterize interoceptive control and some of its dysfunctions. We start from the premise that the goal of interoceptive control is to minimize a discrepancy between expected and actual interoceptive sensations (i.e., a prediction error or free energy). Importantly, living organisms can achieve this goal by using various forms of interoceptive control: homeostatic, allostatic and goal-directed. We provide a computationally-guided analysis of these different forms of interoceptive control, by showing that they correspond to distinct generative models within Active inference. We discuss how these generative models can support empirical research through enabling fine-grained predictions about physiological and brain signals that may accompany both adaptive and maladaptive interoceptive control.},
