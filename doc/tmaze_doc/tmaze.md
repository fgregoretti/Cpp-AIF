# T-Maze

## 1. The problem
In this problem, we examine an agent traversing a T-maze with three arms,
with the agent's initial position being the central location.
One of the bottom arms of the maze includes a cue that provides information about the probable location
of a reward in either of the two top arms, referred to as 'Left' or 'Right'.
